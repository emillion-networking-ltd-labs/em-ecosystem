# AGENTS.md — this repo is governed by Emkeel

Rules that matter live in CI + branch protection, not here (this file is best-effort).

## Loop
1. One branch per ticket: `feat/<KEY-123>-slug` for features; `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/` otherwise.
2. For `feat/` tickets: write `emkeel-governance/specs/<KEY>.md` with an "Acceptance Criteria" section.
3. Every bug fix starts with a failing test (permanent regression guard).
4. Open a PR. Merge requires: CI green + your approval + a linked ticket.

## Strategy (the north star — don't drift)
- A development strategy for an area lives in `emkeel-governance/strategy/<area>.md` (goal,
  architecture, parameters, non-goals). Created once, human-approved, committed.
- **Before working a feature, read the strategy it serves and align to it.** Declare it in the
  spec with a line `Strategy: <area>` (or `Strategy: none` for a deliberate standalone).
- Once any strategy exists, the `check_strategy_link` gate requires that line — so no feature
  merges without a conscious strategy decision. To change direction, update the strategy file
  (human-approved) — never drift silently.

## Separation
- `emkeel-governance/` holds artifacts (specs/adr/records/strategy); it is `export-ignore` (never distributed).
