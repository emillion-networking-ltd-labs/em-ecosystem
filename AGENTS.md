# AGENTS.md — this repo is governed by Emkeel

Rules that matter live in CI + branch protection, not here (this file is best-effort).

## Loop
1. One branch per ticket: `feat/<KEY-123>-slug` for features; `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/` otherwise.
2. For `feat/` tickets: write `emkeel-governance/specs/<KEY>.md` with an "Acceptance Criteria" section.
3. Every bug fix starts with a failing test (permanent regression guard).
4. Open a PR. Merge requires: CI green + your approval + a linked ticket.

## Separation
- `emkeel-governance/` holds artifacts (specs/adr/records); it is `export-ignore` (never distributed).
